# New York Times Article Searcher
## About the App
Upon loading the app, the user is prompted with a search form.  The form parameters are passed into an API call and used to retrieve a list of articles relating to the search.  The *Search Results* table will update dynamically to reflect the user's searches.  Articles can be saved from the results table and will be shown in the *Saved Articles* table.

The saved articles are stored in a database and will populate the table if the app is closed and reopened.
